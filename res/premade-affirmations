I am the one who is going to save me.
There is nothing I can't heal from.
I will choose those who choose me.
Some day I will look back and know exactly why it had to happen.
I still haven't met all of the people who are going to love me.
People will love me, people will hate me, and none of it will have anything to do with me.
Saying how I feel will never ruin a real connection.
It's time to take a deep breath and remember who the *@$! I am.
It's ok if I don't know who I am yet.
I will not give up on the person I am becoming.
Better days are coming.
Today could be my last. So what matters?
We grow (sometimes it feels like hurting at first).
Actually, life is beautiful and I have time.
I will not compare my chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20.
Everything I'm looking for, I can find within myself.
I am allowed to feel the way I feel.
I deserve every good thing this world has to offer and nothing less.
Someone out there is happier because I exist.
Self-care is not selfish.
I deserve all the love and energy that I put into everyone else.
